<<LANGUAGES USED, DEVELOPMENT APPROACH, BUGS, UNFINISHED FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY:>>

<<LANGUAGES>>
    This game was developed by the <<Jared Hayes>> with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
    Audio files are of .wav & .mp3 file formats. 
    Image files are of .png & .ogg file formats.
    Canvas modeling was used for Game playground.

<<APPROACH>>
    My approach was to work through the project focusing first on Canvas creaation, Santa Class creation, Penguin Class creation, and movement logic. Santa is moved with a click_to_move interface, and npc characters are randomly loaded to cross the screen. The objective is to come in contact with the penguins, to stop them from leaving at the bottom of the screen.
    If Santa comes in contact with the polar bear it is Game over (Its Santa against a bear! NOt a winable fight.).

    Next approach was to add srites for Santa and NPC's. The sprites were used with resources from <<OpenGameArt.Org>> https://opengameart.org/.
    
    Next was Displays for Score And Health. Score counts up when Santa hits the penguins.
    Health counts down when penguins escape the screen.

    Then was Audio effects for contact with Santa.
<<BUGS>>
    Bugs were commented out and include: 
    non functiong rotating Santa to face mouse click detection. Game Audio is not playing on load. Sprites not animated.
<<UNFINISHED>>
    Load screen, volume controls and start game button, Game over function when health reaches zero, moving sprit animations.
